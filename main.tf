# main.tf
# Main Terraform configuration file - serves as the entry point for the MinIO HA deployment
# This file is intentionally minimal as the actual resources are organized in separate files
# for better maintainability and modularity

# Placeholder for future modules - currently not used but prepared for future enhancements
# This allows for easy addition of modules like monitoring, backup, or additional services
# module "tags" {
#   source = "hashicorp/null"
